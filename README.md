# carme

A simple Gemini server written in Clojure.

## What's a Gemini server?

Gemini is a lightweight protocol for serving content. Combine the protocol with the gemtext markup language and you get something without the huge weight, complexity and privacy concerns of the modern web.

See https://gemini.circumlunar.space for more information.

## Why should I use your server rather than any of the others?

No reason. Find one you like. Other ones probably have more features at the moment, but this one will work just fine for basic stuff.

## So why did you write it?

For fun. And to learn new things.

## Usage

Configuration is loaded from the `config.edn` file in the working directory, unless overridden.

You must configure where Carme will load server-side certificates from. You have two options; either:

A Java keystore
e.g.

    :keystore          "path/to/keystore.jks"
    :keystore-password "password for keystore"

or a private key and certificate in PEM files (Let's Encrypt are a good source for these)
e.g.

    :privkey-file "path/to/privkey.pem"
    :cert-file    "path/to/fullchain.pem"

If you provide both, the Java keystore has priority.

    lein run [path to config file]

or

    lein uberjar
    
    java -jar target/carme-*-standalone.jar [path to config file]
